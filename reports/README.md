# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the

>
> Answer:

We chose to fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet34 model from the [torchvision library](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet34.html). The ResNet34 model was originally trained on the ImageNet1k dataset, which consists of 1.2 million labeled images across 1,000 classes. This pretraining provides a strong foundation for transfer learning, especially for tasks with limited data like ours.

Why ResNet34?
- Residual Connections: ResNet34 utilizes residual blocks, which help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and enable deeper networks to learn effectively.
- Pretraining Benefits: The model’s pretrained weights on ImageNet1k allow it to extract generic image features that are transferable to our face recognition task.
- Efficiency: ResNet34 strikes a balance between performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on limited hardware resources.

>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we implemented several rules and tools to ensure **code quality, formatting, typing, and documentation** in our project.

- **Linting & Formatting:**  
  We used **Ruff** for **linting and enforcing style guidelines**. The configuration in our `pyproject.toml` file includes:
  ```toml
  [tool.ruff]
  line-length = 120
  [tool.ruff.lint]
  select = ["I", "D101"]

- **I** ensures imports are properly formatted.
- **D101** enforces docstring conventions - to be more exact it forces us to docstring explain every defined class in detail in our project

- **Typing**  
    While Python is dynamically typed, using **type hints** (for return types and function arguments) improves readability and prevents errors.  
    We ensured that function signatures followed **PEP 484** typing conventions.

- **Documentation**  
    We maintained a **`README.md`** file for an overview of the project.  

Why each of these matter: 
Linting & Formatting ensure consistency and more importantly make collaboration and version control easier (i.e. remove unnecessray conflicts on git). Typing helps catch errors early and improves readability in the code. Documentation makes it easier for new developers and colleagues to understand parts of the project they didn't work on but still need to understand or allter.

>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we used **DVC (Data Version Control)** in our project to manage and access data stored on **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**.
By integrating DVC, we were able to: Version control our data to make sure that different experiments used the correct dataset versions, easily access and pull data from Google Cloud Storage which then made collaboration and data sharing across team members efficient and most importantly later when deploying and adding CICD we ensured that our machine learning pipeline has easy access to the data and uses the exact version of it.

> Answer:

For our project we developed several images: one for training, evaluating, inference and deployment. For example to run the
training docker image: `docker run train:latest`. Link to docker file: <https://github.com/ekas13/face_classification/blob/main/dockerfiles/train.dockerfile>

We could build and run our docker images locally or we would build and run them with help of the cloud services: google build would build and then push them to the artifacts registry. Then they were also (command in the same yaml files) ran with Vertex AI (train, evaluate) and deployed with cloud run (api). All of this is triggered everytime when a push to main is done but could also be done manually through the UI or with some CLI prompts.

## Working in the cloud

> In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.

### Question 17

> **List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

We used the following GCP services in our project:

- **Cloud Storage (Bucket)** – Used for storing datasets, model artifacts, and logs. It provides scalable and secure object storage, ensuring data is easily accessible for training and deployment.

- **Cloud Build** – Automates our CI/CD pipeline, enabling us to build, test, and deploy our containerized applications. It's connectd with Cloud Run and Artifact Registry to streamline the deployment process.

- **Cloud Run** – Deploys our containerized application as a serverless service, so we can run our API.

- **Artifact Registry** – Stores and manages Docker images securely. We used it to store our trained models and API container images before deploying them to Cloud Run and the built docker images before running them with Vertex AI.

- **Cloud Monitoring** – Tracks the performance of our deployed services, providing metrics, logs, and alerts.

- **Secret Manager** – Secures sensitive information such as API keys (e.g., `WANDB_API_KEY`). It ensures secrets are managed securely and accessed only by authorized services.

- **IAM & Admin** – Manages permissions and roles, ensuring the correct users and our services have access to our resources while being secure.

- **Vertex AI** – Used for training and deploying machine learning models at scale. It integrates with Cloud Storage and AI pipelines to streamline the ML workflow.

### Question 18

> **The backbone of GCP is the Compute engine. Explained how you made use of this service and what type of VMs**
> **you used?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the compute engine to run our ... . We used instances with the following hardware: ... and we started the*
> *using a custom container: ...*
>
> Answer:

We used Google Compute Engine (GCE) to run our machine learning workloads and support various backend services. 
For our project, we deployed n1-highmem-2 instances with 2 vCPUs and 13GB of RAM for the training and evaluating the models pushed to main immediately with Vertex AI. For training and API hosting later, we used n1-standard-4 instances with 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, and attached NVIDIA T4 GPUs. Our Compute Engine VMs were integrated with Cloud Storage for dataset management and Vertex AI for model training.

### Question 19

### Question 22

> **Did you manage to train your model in the cloud using either the Engine or Vertex AI? If yes, explain how you did**
> **it. If not, describe why.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We managed to train our model in the cloud using the Engine. We did this by ... . The reason we choose the Engine*
> *was because ...*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we successfully trained our model in the cloud using **Google Cloud Compute Engine and Vertex AI**.

Initially, we used **Compute Engine** to manually create virtual machines (VMs) with the required environment for training. We launched a **n1-highmem-2 instance** with **PyTorch pre-installed** and **GPU acceleration (NVIDIA T4)** using:

gcloud compute instances create <instance-name> \
    --zone europe-west4-a \
    --image-family=pytorch-latest-gpu \
    --image-project=deeplearning-platform-release \
    --accelerator="type=nvidia-tesla-t4,count=1" \
    --metadata="install-nvidia-driver=True" \
    --maintenance-policy TERMINATE

We then accessed the VM via SSH, installed dependencies, and ran our training scripts.

Later, to automate and scale our training pipeline, we switched to Vertex AI. Using custom training jobs, we built a Docker container with our training script, pushed it to Artifact Registry, and ran it in Vertex AI with:
gcloud ai custom-jobs create \
    --region=europe-west1 \
    --display-name=test-run \
    --config=config.yaml \
    --command 'python src/my_project/train.py' \
    --args '["--epochs", "10"]'

Additionally, Vertex AI provided seamless integration with Cloud Storage for data handling and automatic GPU allocation. 
In the end for vertex we added the build and run automatically to a trigger everytime it pushes to main and both have to be successful (it's in the pipeline) before merging into main.
